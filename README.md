#### 1 - Clone repo
```

```

#### 2 - Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3 - Update Agora credentals
In order to use this project you will need to replace the agora credentials in `views.py` and `streams.js`.

Create an account at agora.io and create an `app`. Once you create your app, you will want to copy the `appid` & `appCertificate` to update `views.py` and `streams.js`. If you have questions about where to get your app I'd recommend referencing this link `https://youtu.be/HX6AM_1-jNM?t=88`

###### views.py
```
def getToken(request):
    appId = "YOUR APP ID"
    appCertificate = "YOUR APPS CERTIFICATE"
    ......
```

###### streams.js
```
....
const APP_ID = 'YOUR APP ID'
....
```


#### 4 - Start server
```
python manage.py runserver 8000
python manage.py runserver 9000
```

#### 5 - Run

Fake_News_Det.py

## Note
- This news prediction feature is not working in real time, because model was trained on historic & limited data.
- For real time building of this kind of system, we need updated dataset and we need to build a model in particular interval of time, because news data can be updated in seconds, so our model should be also updated with the data.
